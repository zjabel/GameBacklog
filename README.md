<h1>GameBacklog</h1> A collaborative project. It came to me and my friend Aaron Garcia (https://github.com/Argarm) one day looking for the most efficient way to track the games we are playing or have already played.

Today the project is still in its infancy, we will be updating it little by little in our free time.
