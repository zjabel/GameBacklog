<h1>GameBacklog</h1> This is a collaborative project to improve our devs skill. One day looking for the most efficient way to track the games we are playing or have already played my friend Aaron Garcia (https://github.com/Argarm) and me decide to develop a BackLog app to track them.

Today the project is still under nappies but we will be updating it little by little in our free time.
